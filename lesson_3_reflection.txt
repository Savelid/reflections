When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project involving more than one person and/or computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have more freedom to work with the code and potentionally break the code before sharing your changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are a GitHub clone linking back to the content creator (open source stuff),
clone is a copy of a project and branch is a different version of the same project at the same location.
